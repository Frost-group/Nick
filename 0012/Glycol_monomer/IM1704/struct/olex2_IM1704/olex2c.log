 Command line parameters: im1704 -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -t4

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (leave unchanged for
 CGLS). For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or
 3000 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely need
 changing. -t sets the number of threads, otherwise the multi-CPU version
 sets this equal to the number of available CPUs. For optimal performance
 on systems with hyperthreading, usually the hyperthreading should be
 switched off or -t used to halve the number of threads; e.g. -t4 rather
 than -t8 for an Intel i7 processor.

 Command line parameters: im1704 -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -t4

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (leave unchanged for
 CGLS). For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or
 3000 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely need
 changing. -t sets the number of threads, otherwise the multi-CPU version
 sets this equal to the number of available CPUs. For optimal performance
 on systems with hyperthreading, usually the hyperthreading should be
 switched off or -t used to halve the number of threads; e.g. -t4 rather
 than -t8 for an Intel i7 processor.

 Command line parameters: im1704 -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -t4

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (leave unchanged for
 CGLS). For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or
 3000 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely need
 changing. -t sets the number of threads, otherwise the multi-CPU version
 sets this equal to the number of available CPUs. For optimal performance
 on systems with hyperthreading, usually the hyperthreading should be
 switched off or -t used to halve the number of threads; e.g. -t4 rather
 than -t8 for an Intel i7 processor.

 Command line parameters: im1704 -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -t4

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (leave unchanged for
 CGLS). For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or
 3000 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely need
 changing. -t sets the number of threads, otherwise the multi-CPU version
 sets this equal to the number of available CPUs. For optimal performance
 on systems with hyperthreading, usually the hyperthreading should be
 switched off or -t used to halve the number of threads; e.g. -t4 rather
 than -t8 for an Intel i7 processor.

 Command line parameters: im1704 -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -t4

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (leave unchanged for
 CGLS). For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or
 3000 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely need
 changing. -t sets the number of threads, otherwise the multi-CPU version
 sets this equal to the number of available CPUs. For optimal performance
 on systems with hyperthreading, usually the hyperthreading should be
 switched off or -t used to halve the number of threads; e.g. -t4 rather
 than -t8 for an Intel i7 processor.
