abstract = {Conjugated polymers exhibit electrically driven volume changes when included in electrochemical devices via the exchange of ions and solvent. So far, this volumetric change is limited to 40{\%} and 100{\%} for reversible and irreversible systems, respectively, thus restricting potential applications of this technology. A conjugated polymer that reversibly expands by about 300{\%} upon addressing, relative to its previous contracted state, while the first irreversible actuation can achieve values ranging from 1000–10 000{\%}, depending on the voltage applied is reported. From experimental and theoretical studies, it is found that this large and reversible volumetric switching is due to reorganization of the polymer during swelling as it transforms between a solid-state phase and a gel, while maintaining percolation for conductivity. The polymer is utilized as an electroactive cladding to reduce the void sizes of a porous carbon filter electrode by 85{\%}.},

abstract = {Many kinds of stimuli-responsive polymer and gels have been developed and applied to biomimetic actuators or artificial muscles. Electroactive polymers that change shape when stimulated electrically seem to be particularly promising. In all cases, however, the mechanical motion is driven by external stimuli, for example, reversing the direction of electric field. On the other hand, many living organisms can generate an autonomous motion without external driving stimuli like self-beating of heart muscles. Here we show a novel biomimetic gel actuator that can walk spontaneously with a worm-like motion without switching of external stimuli. The self-oscillating motion is produced by dissipating chemical energy of oscillating reaction. Although the gel is completely composed of synthetic polymer, it shows autonomous motion as if it were alive. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.},

abstract = {Electrolyte-gated organic transistors offer low bias operation facilitated by direct contact of the transistor channel with an electrolyte. Their operation mode is generally defined by the dimensionality of charge transport, where a field-effect transistor allows for electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface, whereas an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) facilitates penetration of ions into the bulk of the channel, considered a slow process, leading to volumetric doping and electronic transport. Conducting polymer OECTs allow for fast switching and high currents through incorporation of excess, hygroscopic ionic phases, but operate in depletion mode. Here, we show that the use of glycolated side chains on a thiophene backbone can result in accumulation mode OECTs with high currents, transconductance, and sharp subthreshold switching, while maintaining fast switching speeds. Compared with alkylated analogs of the same backbone, the triethylene glycol side chains shift the mode of operation of aqueous electrolyte-gated transistors from interfacial to bulk doping/transport and show complete and reversible electrochromism and high volumetric capacitance at low operating biases.We propose that the glycol side chains facilitate hydration and ion penetration, without compromising electronic mobility, and suggest that this synthetic approach can be used to guide the design of organic mixed conductors.},

abstract = {Polymer semiconductors have received great attention for organic electronics due to the low fabrication cost offered by solution-based printing techniques. To enable the desired solubility/processability and carrier mobility, polymers are functionalized with hydrocarbon chains by strategically manipulating the alkylation patterns. Note that head-to-head (HH) linkages have traditionally been avoided because the induced backbone torsion leads to poor $\pi$-$\pi$ overlap and amorphous film microstructures, and hence to low carrier mobilities. We report here the synthesis of a new building block for HH linkages, 4,4′-dialkoxy-5,5′-bithiazole (BTzOR), and its incorporation into polymers for high performance organic thin-film transistors. The small oxygen van der Waals radius and intramolecular S(thiazolyl) ⋯O(alkoxy) attraction promote HH macromolecular architectures with extensive $\pi$-conjugation, low bandgaps (1.40-1.63 eV), and high crystallinity. In comparison to previously reported 3,3′-dialkoxy-2,2′-bithiophene (BTOR), BTzOR is a promising building block in view of thiazole geometric and electronic properties: (a) replacing (thiophene)C-H with (thiazole)N reduces steric encumbrance in -BTzOR-Ar.06-0.25 cm2/(V s)) in organic thin-film transistors, as well as enhanced Ion:Ioff ratios and greater ambient stability than the BTOR analogues. These geometric and electronic properties make BTzOR a promising building block for new classes of polymer semiconductors, and the synthetic route to BTzOR reported here should be adaptable to many other bithiazole-based building blocks. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

A series of random copolymers was prepared with glycol side chain percentages of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100 with respect to the alkyl side chains. These were characterized to study the influence of the polar side chains on interaction with aqueous electrolytes, their electrochemical redox reactions, and performance in OECTs when operated in aqueous electrolytes. We observed that glycol side chain percentages of {\textgreater}50{\%} are required to achieve volumetric charging, while lower glycol chain percentages show a mixed operation with high required voltages to allow for bulk charging of the organic semiconductor. A strong dependence of the electron mobility on the fraction of glycol chains was found for copolymers based on NDI-T2, with a significant drop as alkyl side chains are replaced by glycol side chains.},

Replacing alkyl chain with OEG chain can decrease the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance of polymer backbone in thin film from 0.44 to 0.41 nm because OEG chain is more flexible than alkyl chain. As the result, the conjugated polymer with OEG side chain exhibits higher hole mobility, red-shifted absorption spectrum in thin film and smaller bandgap than those of the conjugated polymer with alkyl side chain. With the increase of the length of OEG side chain, the resulting conjugated polymers exhibit unchanged $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance and decreased hole mobility. Moreover, owing to the large polarity of OEG chain, OEG side chain makes the conjugated polymer suitable for polymer solar cell (PSC) devices processed with polar nonhalogenated solvent, methoxybenzene. A power conversion efficiency of 4.04{\%} is demonstrated with the resulting PSC devices. This work provides the new insight into the effect of OEG side chain on conjugated polymer, which can be used in the molecular design of novel conjugated polymer materials with excellent optoelectronic device performance.

Organic electronic devices are particularly promising; the use of robust organic electronic materials provides an ideal biointerface due to their reported biocompatibility, and mechanical matching between the sensor element and the biological environment, are amongst the advantages unique to this class of materials. One promising device emerging from this field is the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Arguably, the most important feature of an OECT is that it provides local amplification and as such can be used as a high fidelity transducer of biological events. Additionally, the OECT combines properties and characteristics that can be tuned for a wide spectrum of biological applications. Here, we frame the development of the OECT with respect to its underlying optimization for a variety of different applications, including ion sensing, enzymatic sensing, and electrophysiology. These applications have allowed the development of OECTs to sense local ionic/biomolecu-lar and single cell activity, as well characterization of tissue and even monitoring of function of whole organs. The body of work reviewed here demonstrates that the OECT is an extremely versatile device that emerges as an important player for therapeutics and diagnostics.},

abstract = {In recent years, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have emerged as attractive devices for a variety of applications, particularly in the area of sensing. While the electrical characteristics of OECTs are analogous to those of conventional organic field effect transistors, appropriate models for OECTs have not yet been developed. In particular, little is known about the transient characteristics of OECTs, which are determined by a complex interplay between ionic and electronic motion. In this paper a simple model is presented that reproduces the steady-state and transient response of OECTs by considering these devices in terms of an ionic and an electronic circuit. A simple analytical expression is derived that can be used to fit steady-state OECT characteristics. For the transient regime, comparison with experimental data allowed an estimation of the hole mobility in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate). This work paves the way for rational optimization of OECTs. {\textcopyright} 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA.},

abstract = {Conjugated polymers that support mixed (electronic and ionic) conduction are in demand for applications spanning from bioelectronics to energy harvesting and storage. To design polymer mixed conductors for high-performance electrochemical devices, relationships between the chemical structure, charge transport, and morphology must be established. A polymer series bearing the same p-type conjugated backbone with increasing percentage of hydrophilic, ethylene glycol side chains is synthesized, and their performance in aqueous electrolyte gated organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is studied. By using device physics principles and electrochemical analyses, a direct relationship is found between the OECT performance and the balanced mixed conduction. While hydrophilic side chains are required to facilitate ion transport—thus enabling OECT operation—swelling of the polymer is not de facto beneficial for balancing mixed conduction. It is shown that heterogeneous water uptake disrupts the electronic conductivity of the film, leading to OECTs with lower transconductance and slower response times. The combination of in situ electrochemical and structural techniques shown here contributes to the establishment of the structure–property relations necessary to improve the performance of polymer mixed conductors and subsequently of OECTs.},

abstract = {We study poly(3-{\{}[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]methyl{\}}thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3MEEMT), a new polythiophene derivative with ethylene glycol-based side chains, as a promising semiconducting polymer for accumulation-mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with figures of merit comparable to those of state-of-the-art materials. By characterizing the OECT performance of P3MEEMT transistors as a function of the anion, we find that large hydrophobic anions lower the threshold voltage. We find that, compared to poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), P3MEEMT has faster anion injection rates, which we attribute to the hydration of the P3MEEMT crystal lattice. We study P3MEEMT-based OECT and organic field-effect transistor (OFET) performance as a function of film crystallinity and show that changing the crystallinity of the polymer by thermal annealing increases the OFET mobility yet decreases the OECT mobility. We attribute this difference to the fact that, unlike OFETs, OECTs operate in aqueous environments. To probe how hydration affects the operation of OECTs, we investigate the role of water in electrochemical doping using electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) gravimetry. We find that steady-state hydration and hydration dynamics under electrochemical bias differ dramatically between the crystalline and amorphous P3MEEMT films. These results suggest that the presence of water reduces the electronic connectivity between the crystalline regions of P3MEEMT, thus lowering the mobility in solution. Overall, our study highlights the importance of the role of polymer hydration and nanoscale morphology in elucidating design principles for OECT operation.},

abstract = {Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) composed of organic mixed conductors can operate in aqueous, biological media and translate low-magnitude ionic fluctuations of biological origin into measurable electrical signals. The growing technological interest in these biotransducers makes the fundamental understanding of ion-to-electron coupling extremely important for the design of new materials and devices. One crucial aspect in this process that has been so far disregarded is the water taken up by the film during device operation and its effects on device performance. Here, using a series of the same electrolyte with varying ion concentrations, we quantify the amount of water that is incorporated into a hydrophilic p-type organic semiconductor film alongside the dopant anions and investigate structural and morphological changes occurring in the film upon electrochemical doping. We show that infiltration of the hydrated dopant ions into the film irreversibly changes the polymer structure and negatively impacts the efficiency, reversibility, and speed of charge generation. When less water is injected into the channel, OECTs exhibit higher transconductance and faster switching speeds. Although swelling is commonly suggested to be a necessity for efficient ion-to-electron transduction, this work uncovers the negative impact of a swollen channel material on the performance of accumulation mode OECTs and lays the foundation for future materials design.},

While a narrow class of conducting polymers continues to excel in these new applications, materials design efforts have accelerated as researchers target new functionality, processability, and improved performance/stability. Materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) require both efficient electronic transport and facile ion injection in order to sustain high capacity. In this work, we show that the product of the electronic mobility and volumetric charge storage capacity (µC*) is the materials/system figure of merit; we use this framework to benchmark and compare the steady-state OECT performance of ten previously reported materials. This product can be independently verified and decoupled to guide materials design and processing. OECTs can therefore be used as a tool for understanding and designing new organic mixed conductors.},

While its hole transport properties have been the subject of intense investigation, recent work has turned to PEDOT:PSS as a mixed ionic/electronic conductor in applications including bioelectronics, energy storage and management, and soft robotics. Conducting polymers can efficiently transport both holes and ions when sufficiently hydrated, however, little is known about the role of morphology on mixed conduction. Here, we show that bulk ionic and electronic mobilities are simultaneously affected by processing-induced changes in nano- and meso-scale structure in PEDOT:PSS films. We quantify domain composition, and find that domain purification on addition of dispersion co-solvents limits ion mobility, even while electronic conductivity improves. We show that an optimal morphology allows for the balanced ionic and electronic transport that is critical for prototypical mixed conductor devices. These findings may pave the way for the rational design of polymeric materials and processing routes to enhance devices reliant on mixed conduction. 1},

abstract = {Ionic transport phenomena in organic semiconductor materials underpin emerging technologies ranging from bioelectronics to energy storage. The performance of these systems is affected by an interplay of film morphology, ionic transport and electronic transport that is unique to organic semiconductors yet poorly understood. Using in situ electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM), we demonstrate that we can directly probe local variations in ion transport in polymer devices by measuring subnanometre volumetric expansion due to ion uptake following electrochemical oxidation of the semiconductor. The ESM data show that poly(3-hexylthiophene) electrochemical devices exhibit voltage-dependent heterogeneous swelling consistent with device operation and electrochromism. Our data show that polymer semiconductors can simultaneously exhibit field-effect and electrochemical operation regimes, with the operation modality and its distribution varying locally as a function of nanoscale film morphology, ion concentration and potential. Importantly, we provide a direct test of structure-function relationships by correlating strain heterogeneity with local stiffness maps. These data indicate that nanoscale variations in ion uptake are associated with local changes in polymer packing that may impede ion transport to different extents within the same macroscopic film and can inform future materials optimization.},

These transistors can be divided into two groups on the basis of their operation mechanism: (i) field-effect transistors that switch fast but carry much less current than (ii) the electrochemical transistors which, on the contrary, switch slowly. An attractive approach would be to combine the benefits of the field-effect and the electrochemical transistors into one transistor that would both switch fast and carry high current densities. Here we report the development of a polyelectrolyte-gated OTFT based on conjugated polyelectrolytes, and we demonstrate that the OTFTs can be controllably operated either in the field-effect or the electrochemical regime. Moreover, we show that the extent of electrochemical doping can be restricted to a few monolayers of the conjugated polyelectrolyte film, which allows both high current densities and fast switching speeds at the same time. We propose an operation mechanism based on self-doping of the conjugated polyelectrolyte backbone by its ionic side groups.},

abstract = {Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFT), gated through an aqueous electrolyte, have extensively been studied as sensors in various applications. These water-gated devices are known to work both as electrochemical (Organic ElectroChemical Transistor - OECT) and field-effect (Organic Field-Effect Transistor - OFET) devices. To properly model and predict the response of water-gated OTFT sensors it is important to distinguish between the mechanism, field-effect or electrochemical, by which the transistor is modulated and thus how the gate signal can be affected by the analyte. In this present study we explore three organic polymer semiconductors, poly-(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT), poly-(3-carboxy-pentyl-thiphene) (P3CPT) and a co-polymer P3HT-co-poly-(3- ethoxypentanoic acid-thiophene) (monomer ratio 1:6, P3HT-COOH15) in water-gated OTFT structures. We report a set of transistor characteristics, including standard output parameters, impedance spectroscopy and current transients, to investigate the origin of the mode of operation in these water-gated OTFTs. Impedance characteristics, including both frequency and voltage dependence, were recorded for capacitor stacks corresponding to the gate/electrolyte/ semiconductor/source structure. It is shown that P3HT as well as P3HT-COOH15 both can function as semiconductors in water gated OTFT devices operating in field-effect mode. P3CPT on the other hand shows typical signs of electrochemical mode of operation. The -COOH side group has been suggested as a possible anchoring site for biorecognition elements in EGOFET sensors, rendering P3HT-COOH15 a possible candidate for such applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Over the past three decades, significant research efforts have focused on improving the charge carrier mobility of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). In recent years, a commonly observed nonlinearity in OTFT current–voltage characteristics, known as the “kink” or “double slope,” has led to widespread mobility overestimations, contaminating the relevant literature. Here, published data from the past 30 years is reviewed to uncover the extent of the field-effect mobility hype and identify the progress that has actually been achieved in the field of OTFTs. Present carrier-mobility-related challenges are identified, finding that reliable hole and electron mobility values of 20 and 10 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, have yet to be achieved. Based on the analysis, the literature is then reviewed to summarize the concepts behind the success of high-performance p-type polymers, along with the latest understanding of the design criteria that will enable further mobility enhancement in n-type polymers and small molecules, and the reasons why high carrier mobility values have been consistently produced from small molecule/polymer blend semiconductors. Overall, this review brings together important information that aids reliable OTFT data analysis, while providing guidelines for the development of next-generation organic semiconductors.},

abstract = {Materials that efficiently transport and couple ionic and electronic charge are key to advancing a host of technological developments for next-generation bioelectronic, optoelectronic and energy storage devices. Here we highlight key progress in the design and study of organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), a diverse family of soft synthetically tunable mixed conductors. Across applications, the same interrelated fundamental physical processes dictate OMIEC properties and determine device performance. Owing to ionic and electronic interactions and coupled transport properties, OMIECs demand special understanding beyond knowledge derived from the study of organic thin films and membranes meant to support either electronic or ionic processes only. We address seemingly conflicting views and terminology regarding charging processes in these materials, and highlight recent approaches that extend fundamental understanding and contribute to the advancement of materials. Further progress is predicated on multimodal and multi-scale approaches to overcome lingering barriers to OMIEC design and implementation.},
