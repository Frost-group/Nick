abstract = {Conjugated polymers exhibit electrically driven volume changes when included in electrochemical devices via the exchange of ions and solvent. So far, this volumetric change is limited to 40{\%} and 100{\%} for reversible and irreversible systems, respectively, thus restricting potential applications of this technology. A conjugated polymer that reversibly expands by about 300{\%} upon addressing, relative to its previous contracted state, while the first irreversible actuation can achieve values ranging from 1000–10 000{\%}, depending on the voltage applied is reported. From experimental and theoretical studies, it is found that this large and reversible volumetric switching is due to reorganization of the polymer during swelling as it transforms between a solid-state phase and a gel, while maintaining percolation for conductivity. The polymer is utilized as an electroactive cladding to reduce the void sizes of a porous carbon filter electrode by 85{\%}.},

abstract = {Many kinds of stimuli-responsive polymer and gels have been developed and applied to biomimetic actuators or artificial muscles. Electroactive polymers that change shape when stimulated electrically seem to be particularly promising. In all cases, however, the mechanical motion is driven by external stimuli, for example, reversing the direction of electric field. On the other hand, many living organisms can generate an autonomous motion without external driving stimuli like self-beating of heart muscles. Here we show a novel biomimetic gel actuator that can walk spontaneously with a worm-like motion without switching of external stimuli. The self-oscillating motion is produced by dissipating chemical energy of oscillating reaction. Although the gel is completely composed of synthetic polymer, it shows autonomous motion as if it were alive. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.},

abstract = {Electrolyte-gated organic transistors offer low bias operation facilitated by direct contact of the transistor channel with an electrolyte. Their operation mode is generally defined by the dimensionality of charge transport, where a field-effect transistor allows for electrostatic charge accumulation at the electrolyte/semiconductor interface, whereas an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) facilitates penetration of ions into the bulk of the channel, considered a slow process, leading to volumetric doping and electronic transport. Conducting polymer OECTs allow for fast switching and high currents through incorporation of excess, hygroscopic ionic phases, but operate in depletion mode. Here, we show that the use of glycolated side chains on a thiophene backbone can result in accumulation mode OECTs with high currents, transconductance, and sharp subthreshold switching, while maintaining fast switching speeds. Compared with alkylated analogs of the same backbone, the triethylene glycol side chains shift the mode of operation of aqueous electrolyte-gated transistors from interfacial to bulk doping/transport and show complete and reversible electrochromism and high volumetric capacitance at low operating biases.We propose that the glycol side chains facilitate hydration and ion penetration, without compromising electronic mobility, and suggest that this synthetic approach can be used to guide the design of organic mixed conductors.},

We show that the backbone of the polyanion plays a major role in determining device performance, while its molecular weight and the counter ion used during PEDOT synthesis play a less important role. We find that transconductance increases with the degree of swelling of the film, consistent with enhanced ion transport.

abstract = {Polymer semiconductors have received great attention for organic electronics due to the low fabrication cost offered by solution-based printing techniques. To enable the desired solubility/processability and carrier mobility, polymers are functionalized with hydrocarbon chains by strategically manipulating the alkylation patterns. Note that head-to-head (HH) linkages have traditionally been avoided because the induced backbone torsion leads to poor $\pi$-$\pi$ overlap and amorphous film microstructures, and hence to low carrier mobilities. We report here the synthesis of a new building block for HH linkages, 4,4′-dialkoxy-5,5′-bithiazole (BTzOR), and its incorporation into polymers for high performance organic thin-film transistors. The small oxygen van der Waals radius and intramolecular S(thiazolyl) ⋯O(alkoxy) attraction promote HH macromolecular architectures with extensive $\pi$-conjugation, low bandgaps (1.40-1.63 eV), and high crystallinity. In comparison to previously reported 3,3′-dialkoxy-2,2′-bithiophene (BTOR), BTzOR is a promising building block in view of thiazole geometric and electronic properties: (a) replacing (thiophene)C-H with (thiazole)N reduces steric encumbrance in -BTzOR-Ar.06-0.25 cm2/(V s)) in organic thin-film transistors, as well as enhanced Ion:Ioff ratios and greater ambient stability than the BTOR analogues. These geometric and electronic properties make BTzOR a promising building block for new classes of polymer semiconductors, and the synthetic route to BTzOR reported here should be adaptable to many other bithiazole-based building blocks. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

A series of random copolymers was prepared with glycol side chain percentages of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, and 100 with respect to the alkyl side chains. These were characterized to study the influence of the polar side chains on interaction with aqueous electrolytes, their electrochemical redox reactions, and performance in OECTs when operated in aqueous electrolytes. We observed that glycol side chain percentages of {\textgreater}50{\%} are required to achieve volumetric charging, while lower glycol chain percentages show a mixed operation with high required voltages to allow for bulk charging of the organic semiconductor. A strong dependence of the electron mobility on the fraction of glycol chains was found for copolymers based on NDI-T2, with a significant drop as alkyl side chains are replaced by glycol side chains.},

Replacing alkyl chain with OEG chain can decrease the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance of polymer backbone in thin film from 0.44 to 0.41 nm because OEG chain is more flexible than alkyl chain. As the result, the conjugated polymer with OEG side chain exhibits higher hole mobility, red-shifted absorption spectrum in thin film and smaller bandgap than those of the conjugated polymer with alkyl side chain. With the increase of the length of OEG side chain, the resulting conjugated polymers exhibit unchanged $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance and decreased hole mobility. Moreover, owing to the large polarity of OEG chain, OEG side chain makes the conjugated polymer suitable for polymer solar cell (PSC) devices processed with polar nonhalogenated solvent, methoxybenzene. A power conversion efficiency of 4.04{\%} is demonstrated with the resulting PSC devices. This work provides the new insight into the effect of OEG side chain on conjugated polymer, which can be used in the molecular design of novel conjugated polymer materials with excellent optoelectronic device performance.

Organic electronic devices are particularly promising; the use of robust organic electronic materials provides an ideal biointerface due to their reported biocompatibility, and mechanical matching between the sensor element and the biological environment, are amongst the advantages unique to this class of materials. One promising device emerging from this field is the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Arguably, the most important feature of an OECT is that it provides local amplification and as such can be used as a high fidelity transducer of biological events. Additionally, the OECT combines properties and characteristics that can be tuned for a wide spectrum of biological applications. Here, we frame the development of the OECT with respect to its underlying optimization for a variety of different applications, including ion sensing, enzymatic sensing, and electrophysiology. These applications have allowed the development of OECTs to sense local ionic/biomolecu-lar and single cell activity, as well characterization of tissue and even monitoring of function of whole organs. The body of work reviewed here demonstrates that the OECT is an extremely versatile device that emerges as an important player for therapeutics and diagnostics.},
